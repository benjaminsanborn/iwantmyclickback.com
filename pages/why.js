            <p>iwantmyclickback.com was born of frustration with internet traffic reporting. Every time I read an asinine article on the internet I regret the fact that my "click" was reported to the creator as positive feedback. I found myself saying, "I want my click back!"</p>
            <p>This site is not intended to target creators, but just to provide a simple outlet when you're frustrated by a lazily written article, or when you fall prey to clickbait.</p>
            <p>Be generous and happy surfing!</p>
